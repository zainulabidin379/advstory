- A brand new logic has been created to give more flexibility to custom story contents.
- Removed `WidgetStory` and implemented 2 new way to create custom story contents:
    - `StoryContent` is an abstract class that gives the full power of `AdvStory` to the developer. `StoryContent` is super class of built-in types, this means you can use any required method by extending this class.
    - `SimpleCustomContent` is a custom story content using resources that can be loaded simultaneously. Eg text, asset image...
- Added `timeout` and `errorBuilder` parameters to video content and image content.
- Added a parameter to set duration for each story except `VideoContent`. You can now set duration for every single story content!
- Removed `setVolume` method from `AdvStoryController`. You can now extend `StoryContent` to create customized controls.
- Added two new parameters to `AdvStory` widget to disable preloading.
- Default loading screen has changed. Shimmer effect was causing a lag.
- Fixed a bug that caused the story to not start when the first content was custom content.
- Improved documentation and example project.

# 0.2.0

**This version has breaking changes**

***Breaking changes***
- `StoryEvent.contentSkip` replaced with `StoryEvent.nextContent` and 
`StoryEvent.previousContent`.
- `StoryEvent.storySkip` replaced with `StoryEvent.nextStory` and `StoryEvent.previousStory`.
- `IndicatorStyle`'s `padding` parameter type changed from `double` to `EdgeInsets`.

***New Features***
- Added interceptor support, you can now capture and block events and call custom callbacks before they happen.
- Decoupled tray list and player, [#3](https://github.com/ertgrulll/advstory/issues/3). `AdvStory.player` constructor allows to creating story view without tray list. Also this constructor doesn't force to full screen story view. Story view expands itself to fit it's parent. Story size, shape, position, opening animation and more can be adjusted.
